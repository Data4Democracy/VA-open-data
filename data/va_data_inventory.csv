The term &#039;pending&#039; has replaced the term &#039;prospective,&#039; which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term &#039;completed&#039; replaced the term &#039;retrospective,&#039; which indicates when appointments actually occurred.",VA-VHA-OIA-1201,2016-12-22,access; appointment; enrollee; ewl; health; health care; near; va; veteran; wait list; wait time,https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,2016-12-22,029:041,Accelerating Access; Pending Appointments,Patient Access Data Pending Appointments - Report 2016 December 15,https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp,R/P2M,en-US,2016-12-15T00:00:00Z/2016-12-15T00:00:00Z,https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp,https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp,VA-VHA-OIA-073,text/html,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf,,,VHA Open Data,mailto:vhaopendata@va.gov,org:Organization,Department of Veterans Affairs,dcat:Distribution,,,pdf,,Pending Appointments 15 Dec 2016,https://www.va.gov/HEALTH/docs/DR60_122016_Pending_and_EWL_Biweekly_Desired_Date_Division.pdf,pdf,Success: (200) OK,https://www.va.gov/HEALTH/docs/DR60_122016_Pending_and_EWL_Biweekly_Desired_Date_Division.pdf

dcat:Dataset,non-public,029:15,TRUE,"The Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System (DEMPS) is the Veterans Health Administrations main deployment program for clinical and non-clinical staff to an emergency or disaster. The DEMPS Program may be used for an internal VA mission, as well as supporting a mission after a Presidential Disaster Declaration under the National Response Frameworks Emergency Support Function #8 (Public Health and Medical Services). Interested, qualified VHA staff can apply online by submitting a DEMPS Application. DEMPS Coordinators and Administrators can manage volunteer data by accessing DEMPS Administration.The DEMPS Program is made up of the following entities:The DEMPS Volunteers (Full-time VHA employee, or Retiree Emergency Reserve Corps Volunteer (ERC)) VAMC DEMPS Coordinator DEMPS VAMC Facility Support Staff (Fiscal, Payroll, and Travel) DEMPS VISN Points of Contact DEMPS National Program Manager VHA Office of Emergency Management staff (Area Emergency Managers, and Regional Emergency Managers) Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, and The DEMPS database. In order for DEMPS to work successfully, all eight entities above must work together to deploy the DEMPS Volunteer to an emergency or disaster site.The DEMPS database was developed to collect specific information on full-time VHA medical personnel (clinical and non-clinical) and Retiree Emergency Reserve Corps (ERC) Volunteers who have volunteered and been approved by their Medical Center Director to be deployed (full-time staff or ERC Volunteers) in the event of a disaster, or to back fill a medical center (ERC Volunteers). When disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, etc., occur and the state and local resources to handle the response/recovery process are overwhelmed, the state in which the disaster occurs may request federal assistance. In this case, a Presidential Disaster Declaration is issued and the National Response Framework (NRF) is activated. Once the damage to the area and needs have been assessed, and it is determined that medical resources are required, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may task VA to provide these resources. Generally, these requests are for medical personnel (nurses, physicians, pharmacists, etc.), pharmaceutical (or other medical) supplies, and medical equipment.

The EPSC staff performs regular telephonic checkups, in conjunction with less frequent in-hospital clinic checkups, to determine when pacemakers need to be replaced. Patients are scheduled and called by the Pacemaker Surveillance Center, and have their electrocardiogram recorded and analyzed over the phone, using wires attached to their fingers and a VHA-supplied transmitter.  Additionally, some patients are monitored via web-based downloads of their device telemetry.  The Pacemaker Center also provides in-hospital clinic checkups for local Washington DC VHA pacemaker patients. All information obtained during the checkups is recorded in the EPSC Database. The database also contains records of pacemaker patients being monitored by VHA facilities east of the Mississippi and who are not being monitored directly by their respective VA medical centers.

Studies have shown that embedded fragments are not inert in the body, but may breakdown slowly over time and potentially affect an individualï¿½s health. The recognition of potential short and long-term health effects of embedded fragments and the large number of soldiers with injuries resulting in embedded fragments led the Presidential Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes to recommend that the VHA establish a registry and medical surveillance program for Veterans with retained fragments. The Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center (TEFSC) has been established at the Baltimore VA Medical Center to coordinate this charge. A critical component of the TEFSC medical surveillance program is the development of an Embedded Fragment Registry.

EPI is designed to automatically collect data on emerging diseases for Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) to analyze.

VACO data retrieval and analysis is then carried out.

These files are manipulated and used for analysis and reporting by the National Infectious Diseases Service. Emerging Pathogens (as characterized by VACO) act as triggers for data acquisition activities in the automated program. The system retrieves relevant, predetermined, patient-specific information in the form of a Health Level Seven (HL7) message that is transmitted to the central data repository at the AITC. Once at that location, the data is converted to a SAS dataset for analysis by the VACO National Infectious Diseases Service.

The primary purpose is to provide HBPC management with case mix, case load, and other performance information. The HBPC information system is referred to as HBC at the VA Austin Information Technology Center and as HBHC at the local level. The HBHC automated a paper-based system of reporting home care episodes. When an admission form is completed, an episode is opened and input into HBHC for a potential home care patient. The patient is evaluated and accepted to or rejected from the program. When a patient leaves the program for any reason an episode is closed and a discharge form completed and input into HBHC. HBHC runs a nightly extract of information within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture. Extractions include information on all Patient Care Encounters (PCEs) with the patient and home visits made by home care providers. Details of which provider(s) made the visit, the date, any diagnosis and any procedures performed are included. Each local application sends its data to the Austin HBC database on a monthly basis. A monthly report is prepared based on this information identifying the active cases at each VAMC.

Increase the quality of the services to our Veterans by providing a means to develop consistency in services, review prescription and management practices, develop training, monitor Home Medical Equipment, and measure performance improvements. Reduce costs by comparing costs system-wide, identifying common items for consolidated contracting, identifying costs for Medical Cost Care Funds (MCCF) purposes and improving contracting cost benefit. Improve efficiency by validating the data, improving budget management, determining where coding errors occur, providing training, and comparing unique social security numbers for multiple site usage and item issue. The NPPD Menu provides patient information, patient eligibility, Prosthetic treatment, date of provision, cost, vendor, and purchasing agent information. This system tracks average cost data and its usage and provides on both a monthly and quarterly basis detailed and summary reports by station, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and agency. The NPPD Menu resides in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) at the medical center level. This data is updated quarterly. Data is rolled up at each facility and transmitted to Hines. The data is then loaded into the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) from which data extracts are done.

dcat:Dataset,non-public,029:15,TRUE,"The Nuclear Medicine National HQ System database is a series of MS Excel spreadsheets and Access Database Tables by fiscal year. They consist of information from all Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) performing or contracting nuclear medicine services in Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The medical centers are required to complete questionnaires annually (RCS 10-0010-Nuclear Medicine Service Annual Report). The information is then manually entered into the Access Tables, which includes: * Distribution and cost of in-house VA - Contract Physician Services, whether contracted services are made via sharing agreement (with another VA medical facility or other government medical providers) or with private providers. * Workload data for the performance and/or purchase of PET/CT studies. * Organizational structure of services. * Updated changes in key imaging service personnel (chiefs, chief technicians, radiation safety officers). * Workload data on the number and type of studies (scans) performed, including Medicare Relative Value Units (RVUs), also referred to as Weighted Work Units (WWUs). WWUs are a workload measure calculated as the product of a study&#039;s Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, which consists of total work costs (the cost of physician medical expertise and time), and total practice costs (the costs of running a practice, such as equipment, supplies, salaries, utilities etc). Medicare combines WWUs together with one other parameter to derive RVUs, a workload measure widely used in the health care industry. WWUs allow Nuclear Medicine to account for the complexity of each study in assessing workload, that some studies are more time consuming and require higher levels of expertise. This gives a more accurate picture of workload; productivity etc than using just &#039;total studies&#039; would yield. * A detailed Full-Time Equivalent Employee (FTEE) grid, and staffing distributions of FTEEs across nuclear medicine services. * Information on Radiation Safety Committees and Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs).  Beginning in 2011 this will include data collection on part-time and non VA (contract) RSOs; other affiliations they may have and if so to whom they report (supervision) at their VA medical center.*Collection of data on nuclear medicine services&#039; progress in meeting the special needs of our female veterans.* Revolving documentation of all major VA-owned gamma cameras (by type) and computer systems, their specifications and ages. * Revolving data collection for PET/CT cameras owned or leased by VA; and the numbers and types of PET/CT studies performed on VA patients whether produced on-site, via mobile PET/CT contract or from non-VA providers in the community.* Types of educational training/certification programs available at VA sites * Ongoing funded research projects by Nuclear Medicine (NM) staff, identified by source of funding and research purpose. * Data on physician-specific quality indicators at each nuclear medicine service.* Academic achievements by NM staff, including published books/chapters, journals and abstracts. * Information from polling field sites re: relevant issues and programs Headquarters needs to address. * Results of a Congressionally mandated contracted quality assessment exercise, also known as a Proficiency study. Study results are analyzed for comparison within VA facilities (for example by mission or size), and against participating private sector health care groups. * Information collected on current issues in nuclear medicine as they arise.  Radiation Safety Committee structures and membership, Radiation Safety Officer information and information on how nuclear medicine services provided for female Veterans are examples of current issues.The database is now stored completely within MS Access Database Tables with output still presented in the form of Excel graphs and tables.",VA-VHA-PCS-011,2017-07-26,cost; cpt; medicine; nuclear; pet; radiation; scan; va; veteran,https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,2013-12-30,029:041,Basic Statistics; Use; and Operational Data,Nuclear Medicine National Headquarter System,,,en-US,1992-01-01T00:00:00Z/2014-12-31T00:00:00Z,,,,,,"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,VHA Open Data,mailto:vhaopendata@va.gov,org:Organization,Department of Veterans Affairs,,,,,,,,,,

Users with appropriate security privileges are allowed to add and sign or co-sign the encounter and, if needed, perform scheduled and unscheduled reporting on items such as vaccination rates, vaccination and immunity statuses. The OHRS application does not share patient-specific data, but will collect data elements limited to information deemed critical to the Occupational Health delivery of care processes in the OHRS database. Employee data is obtained from the central Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data System (PAID) while volunteer information is obtained from the Voluntary Service System (VSS).

The PAI questions cover medical treatments, conditions, selected diagnoses, activities of daily living, behaviors, some rehabilitation therapies, and chronic respiratory support. The database is managed by the Geriatrics &amp; Extended Care Strategic Health Care Group in the Office of Patient Care Services. It is currently running at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) and is stored in flat files. PAF&#039;s primary customer is the Allocation Resource Center (ARC) in Braintree MA. The ARC receives the data from AITC and combines it with data from the Patient Treatment File (PTF) which contains more detailed demographic and treatment information. The ARC builds ORACLE tables, assigning RUG II (Resource Utilization Group II) scores and weighted work units reflecting the level and type of care needed. The 16 different weighted work units, ranging from 479 to 1800, are a factor in the resource allocation and budget decisions on long-term care, and are used to measure efficiency. The data is also used in other reports to Central Office, the Veterans Integrated Service Networks, and the facilities.

The VA commitment to quality propelled the implementation of the RAI/MDS in its nursing homes now known as VA Community Living Centers (CLC). In addition to providing consistent clinical information, the RAI/MDS can be used as a measure of both quality and resource utilization, thereby serving as a benchmark for quality and cost data within the VA as well as with community based nursing facilities. Workload based on RAI/MDS can be calculated electronically by the interactions of the elements of the MDS data and grouped into 53 categories referred to as Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).

While the database has been in operation since 1995, the system only contains data for the current fiscal year. The data from previous fiscal years is archived if later retrieval is needed. Valid transmissions are sent to the VASQIP office at Denver for analysis. Information from non-assessed surgeries is transmitted from the VAMCs to the Hines OI Field Office monthly.

dcat:Dataset,non-public,029:15,TRUE,"The VA National Clozapine Registry tracks the health and demographics of patients who have been prescribed clozapine by the VA. Clozapine, or the brand name Clozaril, is a drug used to treat the most serious cases of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, clozapine may also affect portions of the blood, lowering the body&#039;s resistance to infection and sometimes creating life-threatening circumstances. Realizing the severity of the problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established guidelines for analysis of White Blood Cells and Neutrophils and set strict minimum limits. The FDA also mandated that any manufacturer of clozapine must maintain a Clozapine Registry. These registries are to track the location and the health of clozapine patients and to ensure &#039;weekly White Blood Cell testing prior to delivery of the next week&#039;s supply of medication&#039;. To date, the clozapine manufacturer registries have been unable to develop sufficient controls to meet these requirements, especially the ability to prevent dispensing clozapine when blood results are abnormal. However, because of the unique structure of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, the Veterans Health Administration obtained permission from the FDA and clozapine manufacturers to use its in-place computer network to gather and evaluate weekly patient information, then export this data to manufacturer clozapine registries. The VA assigned functional administration of this effort to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in Dallas, Texas. Weekly data on each VA clozapine patient is processed at two locations. Facility Level --When a clozapine prescription is written, a computer program in each facility&#039;s internal computer system retrieves white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and clozapine dose and evaluates the information according to FDA guidelines. If an adverse blood condition is found, the computer may warn to trigger a physician reevaluation, or lock out entirely to prevent dispensing, depending on the severity. Weekly, this information, along with certain patient demographic information, is gathered locally and transmitted to Hines Office of Information &amp; Technology Field Office for centralized storage. This data can only be accessed by the NCCC. Raw data is downloaded from the Hines OI Field Office database on a weekly basis. An ancillary computer program reformats the data and evaluates the information for inconsistencies and data gathering errors. The computer-corrected data is manually compared with hand-written facsimile information sent to the NCCC by each site. This manually corrected data is again reformatted for data storage in MS Access format at the NCCC. The corrected data is also reformatted into American Standard Code for Information Interchange fixed-length fields and transmitted via modem to the manufacturers&#039; Clozapine Registry and, in turn, to the FDA.",VA-VHA-PBM-005,2017-07-26,clozapine; clozaril; drug; fda; infection; medication; neutrophils; patient; registry; va; veteran,https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,2013-12-30,029:041,Basic Statistics; Use; and Operational Data,VA National Clozapine Registry,,,en-US,1991-01-01T00:00:00Z/2014-12-31T00:00:00Z,,,,,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf,"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,VHA Open Data,mailto:vhaopendata@va.gov,org:Organization,Department of Veterans Affairs,,,,,,,,,,

EWL is able to determine a status change in the veteran&#039;s service connected percentage and service connected priority. As well as changes to appointment, clinics, and personnel that affect Wait List patients. EWL is able to provide email notifications regarding status changes to assigned mail groups. In the outpatient setting, patients are assigned a primary care team and provider who are responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for specialty care. This is accomplished through the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). When a patient cannot be assigned to a primary care team or position, the PCMM software asks if the patient should be placed on the EWL.  PCMM Wait List reports assist in the management of patients awaiting a primary care team or provider assignment. The EWL can also produce reports on demand regarding EWL related activities.

In a Primary Care setting, patients are assigned a PCP, Associate Provider (AP) and/or a Transition Patient Advocate (TPA) who is responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for specialty care.  The PCP is supported by a team of professionals which may include nurses, pharmacists, social workers, etc.  Associate Providers are non-physician clinicians (such as Physicians Assistants, Nurse Practitioners or Residents) who may provide care under the supervision of a presiding PCP.
