# VA-Open-Data
Analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Veterans Affairs

## Abstract
Combat veterans experience high rates of post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, chronic homelessness,
substance abuse and suicide as a result of their military service. The US Department of Veterans Affairs provides a 
variety of mental health services to address these issues, many of which are offered through partnerships with state and local
governments, non-profit organizations and/or state and private universities. This analysis will focus on how these partnerships
effect the efficacy of federal tax dollars in addressing these mental health issues.
