# VA-Open-Data
Analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Veterans Affairs

## Project Aims

### Raise public awareness for veteran related issues
Healthcare and Disability (PTS, TBI, suicide, homelessness, substance abuse)
Education, Employment, and Housing (GI Bill, VA home loans)

### Improve VA transparency and accountability
The public should be aware how their local VA facilities are performing relative to other facilities around the country. This can promote grassroots efforts and non-profits to fill in the gaps.

### Increase utilization of VA, Nonprofit, and Privately offered services to veterans
Many VA services are underutilized because veterans are simply unaware of them (I have personal anecdotes). There are also a plethora of non-profits and private groups offering services to veterans.

## Methods
I'm hoping to achieve these aims by creating a gallery of interactive visualizations that can be distributed under the Data for Democracy brand. Our metrics initially will be page views. Later iterations of the project could include a well maintained dashboard for veterans, local governments, and members of the public to utilize.
